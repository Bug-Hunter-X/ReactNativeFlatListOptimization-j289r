This React Native bug arises when using the `FlatList` component with a large dataset and improper key extraction.  If the `keyExtractor` prop isn't correctly implemented or is missing, React Native might struggle to efficiently update and render the list items, leading to performance issues, unexpected rendering behavior, or even crashes.  Specifically, if keys are duplicated or not unique for each item, React Native may reuse existing components incorrectly, resulting in visual glitches or incorrect data display.  For instance, if your key is based on a value that can change, even if the item itself is different, React Native will think it's the same component and reuse the component with the wrong data.
