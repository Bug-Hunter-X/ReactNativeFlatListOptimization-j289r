The solution lies in providing a unique `key` for each item in your `FlatList`.  This key should be a unique identifier for that specific item and not something that could change over time.  A good choice is often the item's ID from your data source. 

Here's a corrected implementation that includes a proper `keyExtractor`:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { FlatList, Text, View } from 'react-native';

const data = [
  { id: '1', name: 'Item 1' },
  { id: '2', name: 'Item 2' },
  { id: '3', name: 'Item 3' },
  // ... more items
];

const App = () => {
  return (
    <FlatList
      data={data}
      renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
      keyExtractor={item => item.id} // Correct keyExtractor
    />
  );
};

export default App;
```
By using the unique `id` field as the key, React Native can effectively manage the rendering and update processes, ensuring optimal performance and preventing rendering problems.
